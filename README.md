## Brief Description

Film Fanatic is the ultimate mobile app for movie enthusiasts and anyone who wants to stay up-to-date on the latest and greatest in cinema. Film Fanatic gives users the platform to post reviews on their favorite movies. It will have two business features: Movie Panels and Reviews. Movie panels are panels dedicated to a specific movie, They hold data about the movie and also the reviews on the movie. Reviews are rating and a short paragraph by users on a specific movie. While all users have full CRUD ability on reviews and can view all movies, only Admins(users with admin role) have full CRUD capabilities on movie panels. In other words only admins can post( or edit or delete for that matter) movie panels; whereas any user(regardless of their role) can post a review. Whether you're a casual moviegoer or a dedicated film fanatic, Film Fanatic offers a user-friendly platform for sharing your opinions on movies and seeing what others think of them.
